# Python Programs: Basic Mathematical Operations & Personalized Greeting

## **Overview**
This repository contains two simple Python programs:  

1. **Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations**  
2. **Task 2: Create a Personalized Greeting**  

Each program is designed to take user input and provide meaningful output based on basic programming concepts.

### **Description**  
This program takes two integer inputs from the user and performs the following mathematical operations:  
- **Addition**  
- **Subtraction**  
- **Multiplication**  
- **Division**

## **Task 2: Create a Personalized Greeting**  
**Filename:** `Task2.py`  

### **Description**  
This program takes the user's first and last name as input, concatenates them to form the full name, and prints a personalized greeting message.  

### **Usage**  
Run the script and enter your first and last name when prompted. The program will generate a greeting message.  

### **Example Output**  
```d
Enter your first name: John
Enter your last name: Doe
